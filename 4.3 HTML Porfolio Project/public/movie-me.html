<h1>The Best Movies According to Prathima</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>After</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time. The After film series consists of American romantic-dramas based on the Anna Todd authored After novels. The plot centers around the positive and negative experiences of a romantic relationship between a young couple named Tessa and Hardin.</p>
<h3>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</h3>
<p>I'll never stop loving this one. Alizeh, an independent woman recovering from a breakup, and Ayan, a naive musician, meet in New York and form an incredible bond. From there, they experience love, heartbreak and the facts of life.</p>
<h3>Somewhere Only We Know</h3>
<p>One of my favourite Chinese movie. This story talks about the female lead, Jin Tian, who is experiencing the hardest time of her life: her boyfriend backed out of their marriage, while her beloved grandmother passed away. Heartbroken, she goes to Prague in Europe to heal her broken heart. And then the male lead, Ze Yang suddenly appears, while she slowly finds out about her grandmotherâ€™s love story.</p>
